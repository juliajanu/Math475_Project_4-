    "The most prized individual accolade for a player in the NBA is the Most Valuable Player award. This award signifies that coaches, the media, and former players thought that the winner of this award was the most important player in the entire league. There have been 65 different players who have won this award. These players played different positions, had different statistics, and come from different eras. What then, do they have in common? Can we predict who will have an MVP season? What do a players statistics indicate about their chances of winning the award? Given the right dataset, these are all questions that could potentially be answered. Unfortunately, obtaining the data to answer these sorts of questions is not always as straight forward as downloading a dataset from kaggle. In this case, there exists a dataset containing player statistics for a season, but it lacks which player won the MVP. Can we solve this problem? Can we pull data from basketball reference, combine it with data on player statistics, and then use that data to make a simple model? These are the questions that we seek to answer. In the process, we will use libraries like BeautifulSoup to parse basketball refrence, and various pandas operations to combine the datasets."

    "There are three key skills we would like to demonstrate. The first being scraping data from the internet. Scraping data from the internet is a useful skill because there is not always a dataset available for any problem that needs to be solved.  We will accomplish this using the python library BeautifulSoup. Next, we will attempt to combined our scraped dataset with data that already exists. Finally, we will display the skill of fitting a simple model to try and predict who will be an MVP."

    "## Combining The Data <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"combining\"></a>\n",
    "At this point, we are now going to begin the process of combining our two datasets. This proved to be no small task. Initially, we attempted to just find any player who was in both datasets. If the player was contained in both datasets, they would get a 1 to indicate they were the mvp. However, this idea was highly flawed. What was produced was a dataset that implied Steve Nash was the MVP in 1996 when he averaged 3 points a game. After much pondering, we determined that the best solution would be to compare the name of the player and the year of the season. To accomplish this, manipulation of the dataset was required. First, the index of the dataset was changed. Instead of being indexed by numbers, we chose to temporarily index the dataset by the players name concatenated with the year. For example, James Harden's 2017 season would temporarily be indexed by James Harden2017.0. Manipulating the dataset in this way enabled us to put a 1 in locations where the name and year matched and 0 in locations where they did not. Finally, we added a new column to the dataset denoting if the player was an MVP or not. "

    "Finally, we have the answer to our 'big question'. We will now recap what unfolded. First, data was parsed from basketball-reference to obtain information on which players won the MVP and in what year. Then, a dataset containing season stats was imported from kaggle. Next, a feature indicating if a player was an allstar that season was engineered based on a '*' contained in the players name. Lastly, a new dataset was created by combining our MVP dataset and our season stats dataset. This new dataset contains season stats and information about whether a player won the mvp or was an allstar that season. "
